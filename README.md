# Black Friday Shopping Habits

### Shopping behavior data analysis


In this module, I am going to explore shopping habits of consumers during Black Friday. This will involve some data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning to predict consumer spending in USD.

This dataset explores the purchasing power during a Black Friday shopping spree. Uses features such as age, city, occupation, gender, and category of items purchased. My goal is to estimate the amount a buyer is spending during that one day of the year. I have chosen this dataset because the information seem interesting and useful for a retail stores that wishes to understand the demographics or items they ought to invest in for future events.
